# About UPSC
>
**The civil services offer fine opportunities to the youth for serving the people. Our country needs honest, efficient, competent and dynamic officers who know the ethos of the land.
Pessimists may contend that the pass percentage is abysmally low, making the effort of most candidates futile. In 2014, nearly 9.5 lakh candidates filed their applications. In 2016, there would be a million applicants, half of whom may appear in the preliminary exam, competing for a thousand seats. But there is a positive side. A candidate who prepares steadily for nearly 15 months with commitment for improving language skills, widening general knowledge, mastering strategies for facing objective as well as descriptive questions, perfecting interview techniques and building self-confidence will certainly have developed strong competitive muscles. This will help the candidate in winning any other competition of a similar nature. However, let us focus on success. The selection would be for nearly 24 services including the IFS, IAS and IPS.**

## EXAM PATTERN

<img src="/img/banners/pre exam pattern.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/>

> **The preliminary stage consists of two papers, each of two hours. Each paper carries 200 marks and contains only objective-type multiple-choice questions, with 4 options against each question. There is negative marking for wrong answers. Paper 1 focuses on knowledge, while Paper 2 stresses logic. Calculators are not allowed in the test. You should score at least 33 per cent marks in Paper 2. The marks scored in the preliminary examination do not count for the final ranking. This is only a screening test for selecting the candidates for the main examination. The number of candidates to be admitted to the main examination will be about 13 times the vacancies.**

## Personality Test ( INTERVIEW )

>
**The interview will carry 275 marks (with no minimum qualifying marks). Marks thus obtained by the candidates in the Main Examination(written part as well as interview) would determine their final ranking. (Ranking is based on score out of 2025 Marks).  
Candidates will be allotted to the various services keeping in view their ranks in the Examination and the preferences expressed by them for the various services and posts.  
The number of candidates to be summoned for interview will be about twice the number of vacancies to be filled.  
The candidate will be interviewed by a Board who will have before them a record of his career. He will be asked questions on matters of general interest.  
The object of the interview is to assess the personal suitability of the candidate for a career in public service by a Board of competent and unbiased observers. The test is intended to judge the mental caliber of a candidate. In broad terms this is really an assessment of not only his intellectual qualities but also social traits and his interest in current affairs.
Some of the qualities to be judged are mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgment, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, intellectual and moral integrity.  
The technique of the interview is not that of a strict cross-examination but of a natural, though directed and purposive conversation which is intended to reveal the mental qualities of the candidate.  
The interview test is not intended to be a test either of the specialized or general knowledge of the candidates which has been already tested through their written papers. Candidates are expected to have taken an intelligent interest not only in their special subjects of academic study but also in the events which are happening around them both within and outside their own State or Country as well as in modern currents of thought and in new discoveries which should rouse the curiosity of well-educated youth.**
